# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project is developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence Internship at Syntecxhub.

The project demonstrates basic hand detection and gesture recognition concepts using Python.
The demo is executed using Google Colab.

## Project Structure
- gesture_recognition.py : Source code
- requirements.txt : Required libraries
- README.md : Project documentation
- demo_video.mp4 : Demo video (optional)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Google Colab Demo

## How the Project Works
1. A hand image is uploaded to Google Colab
2. Required libraries are installed
3. The image is processed using OpenCV
4. Hand features are detected and displayed

## Output
The hand image is successfully processed and visualized.

## Note
Due to MediaPipe compatibility issues with Python 3.12 in Google Colab,
the demo uses OpenCV-based hand detection for visualization.
